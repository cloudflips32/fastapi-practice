# FastAPI Practice

The FastAPI Tutorial – User Guide offers a hands‑on, step‑by‑step learning path designed for developers building APIs with Python. It’s structured to serve both as a progressive learning tool and a practical reference for specific API problems

.

You start by running code samples directly, copying them into a main.py file and launching with fastapi dev main.py. This launches a development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000, complete with automatic reloads and integrated documentation via Swagger UI 
FastAPI
.

The tutorial begins with installation: typically using pip install "fastapi[standard]", which provides optional dependencies (like fastapi‑cloud‑cli). Alternately, you can install the core FastAPI package alone

.

The first tutorial segment, First Steps, walks you through creating a minimal API. You import FastAPI, instantiate it, and define a simple endpoint using decorators such as @app.get("/") that returns a JSON response like {"message": "Hello World"} 
FastAPI
. It clarifies how decorators map HTTP methods and paths to endpoint functions.

From there, the guide expands to include parameters, request bodies, validations, nested models, error handling, dependencies, security, performance features, testing, and more. Each section builds on the previous, offering an organized, modular structure that supports both beginners and experienced developers
